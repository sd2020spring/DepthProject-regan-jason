## <strong>What is Softdes Partner Finder</strong>

SoftDes Partner Finder is a game that focuses on you--the player character--as you traverse the Software Design landscape to find the perfect partner. Like most individuals who have a mind of their own, you have preferences on who you'd prefer to work on a project with and your partner is crucial to your academic success. This decision could mean the difference between life or death, so take your due diligence and scout out the local talent!

## <strong>How The Game Was Made</strong>

To make a game with python, we relied on a set of modules called pygame to help display and control the player character. <br>

When making our game, we organized our foundation into 4 main components.

<strong>Drawing:</strong> This is where we managed all the visual components of the game including text, the map, and all in-game characters.<br> 


<strong>Game:</strong> This is where we organized the main game loop, controls, and initialization. We used this section to run the game loop and house global variables and gameplay conditions. 

<strong>Objects:</strong> Our objects included things from our main actor class (which represents all active characters) as well as tiles that helped shape the impassable walls around the game. These objects were the structure in which we drew and interacted with different components within the game.<br>

<strong>Constants:</strong> Our constants housed all the colors, sprites, player names, traits, and measurements we used in the game in an organized layout.

## <strong>Download the game</strong>

To download the game, head to this [Link:](https://github.com/sd2020spring/DepthProject-regan-jason) <br>

You'll want to make sure to read the README (as it tells you which files that you need as well as the controls) and then just simply run the partner_finder_run.py in python. The game window should pop up, and you should be able to talk to your fellow classmates!

## <strong>Playing the game</strong>

### <strong>Installation</strong> 
SoftDes Partner finder is built and dependent on pygame. To install pygame:
```
pip install pygame
```

### <strong>Running the game</strong>
To run the game, simply run
```
python partner_finder_run.py
```

## <strong>The Gameplay Loop</strong>

Instead of human beings, the software design class will be filled with dogs this time around. <br>

Every student (21 in total including you) will have randomly generated traits everytime you play the game. To find out what your traits are, you will have to speak to the professor on the top left part of the game window. You will then have to talk to all your classmates to find out their traits. You will have an option to select your partner on the spot at the end of your dialogue with any student to lock in your choice. Your objective is to choose someone who has all 3 traits that match with yours.

### TLDR
Here is an image of your player character

<strong>1.</strong> Talk to the professor on the top left area of the game with the <strong>[space bar]</strong> to find out what traits you have.

<strong>2.</strong> Talk to your classmates with the <strong>[space bar]</strong> to look for a partner with the same 3 traits as you. 

<strong>3.</strong> At the end of the conversation, press yes <strong>[y key]</strong> or no <strong>[n key]</strong> and decide who your teammate is, this will give you one of 3 endings.

Depending on your decision, the three decisions will be largely different so good luck and have fun with it!

## <strong>HOW TO PLAY/KEYS</strong>

<strong>Left</strong> = left arrow <br>

<strong>Up</strong> = up arrow <br>
<strong>Down</strong> = down arrow <br> 
<strong>Interact/Talk</strong> = Space Bar <br>
<strong>Yes</strong> = Y <br> 
<strong>No</strong> = N <br>


## <strong>About the creators</strong>

Regan is an Olin student while Jason is a Babson student. They were randomly paired for Mini-project 4, but had such a good final project idea that even in the face of COVID, they were prepared to see it through. This wonderful game is a simulation (not really) of the Olin Softdes class environment, and the joys of knowing that people have different work habits, and how they may or may not mesh well. Regan and Jason (despite being from Olin and Babson) managed to smoothly create a game that reminds us all that its okay to work with others, and in fact, you may get more out of it than you would think.
